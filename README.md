# Quick QR Code Add-on

Quick QR Code add-on for Adobe Express. Created by Kerri Shotts, with graphical assistance from Shannon McCready.

This add-on allows users to quickly create QR Codes while they're editing their documents. They can choose the size to import, how much margin to apply, and whether the QR Code should render transparently.
